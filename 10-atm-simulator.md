# ATM Simulator: A Proud Milestone in My Programming Journey

Six years ago, during my early programming days, I embarked on a project that remains close to my heart: an ATM simulator. Developed in C++ with my friend Umer, this project was a simulation of basic ATM functionalities, allowing users to check balances, withdraw, and deposit money. While it didn't involve real API calls or financial transactions, it was a significant achievement at the time.

## The ATM Simulator Project

The ATM simulator was designed to mimic the core operations of an ATM, providing a user-friendly interface to manage virtual bank transactions. Though it was a simple simulation, the project was a fantastic learning experience. It taught me about control structures, user input handling, and basic data management in C++.

### Why I'm Proud of It

Looking back, the ATM simulator may seem like a modest project, but I'm incredibly proud of it. It was one of the first substantial programs I created, and it marked a significant step in my programming journey. The project not only boosted my confidence in coding but also ignited a passion for software development.

### Encouragement to Aspiring Developers

I encourage everyone, especially those new to programming, to take on similar projects. Creating simulations like this ATM can provide valuable hands-on experience and a sense of accomplishment. These projects serve as a foundation for more complex endeavors and help solidify programming concepts.

### Watch the Simulation

For those interested, you can watch the ATM simulator in action on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bok1nS1WUCE&t=204s). The video showcases the simulator's functionality and offers a glimpse into the early stages of my programming journey.

## Conclusion
The ATM simulator was more than just a project; it was a learning adventure that laid the groundwork for future achievements. Whether you're starting out or looking to refine your skills, I urge you to create projects that challenge and inspire you. The knowledge and pride gained from such endeavors are invaluable.
