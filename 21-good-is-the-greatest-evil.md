"Good" is the greatest evil:
- when you think you are doing good, it may not only slow you down, but also impact your personality.
- In my childhood, I was intelligent. My mom taught me to "not be proudy". And it is helping me a lot since them.
- And I always know that one, others always have something i can learn form.
- two, if i become proudy, it will not only impact my character, but also my behaviour
- Similarly, it applies to religion also. More you think you are offering prayers, more bad it is for you. Fear of Allah should always stay.
- And why i'm adding it here in this post, because when you think you know many skills, or you are good at it. It will impact your learning.
- Always be a student.
