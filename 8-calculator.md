# Tinkering in Free Time: Creating a Calculator with Processing i3

During my teenage years, I embarked on a fun and educational project that marked one of my early achievements in programming. It wasn't the most groundbreaking endeavor, but it was a fantastic exercise in programming practice and a source of personal satisfaction. I created a simple calculator using the Processing i3 programming language.

## The Project: A Simple Calculator

This project was all about building a basic calculator that could perform standard arithmetic operations. While it may seem trivial now, at the time, it was a significant step forward in my programming journey. The project taught me the fundamentals of coding logic, user interface design, and the intricacies of handling user input.

### Processing i3: The Tool of Choice

Processing i3 was the programming environment I used to bring this calculator to life. It's a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Using Processing i3 allowed me to experiment with creative coding and develop an intuitive understanding of programming concepts.

### Sharing the Journey

I documented this project in a video, which you can view on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTt8Qm4tHFY). The video showcases the functionality of the calculator and provides insights into the code and design process. It has received positive feedback from viewers who appreciated the simplicity and effectiveness of the project.

## Community Engagement and Feedback

The response to the video was encouraging, with comments highlighting appreciation for the work and requests for the source code. It was gratifying to see others take an interest in the project, and I was happy to engage with viewers who had questions or wanted to learn more about the code.

## Why Such Projects Matter

Though this calculator was a simple project, it served as a foundational learning experience. It reinforced the importance of tinkering and experimenting as a means of developing programming skills. For anyone interested in programming, I highly recommend taking on similar projects. They provide a practical and enjoyable way to learn, and the sense of achievement upon completion is immensely rewarding.

## Conclusion

Creating this calculator was a small yet significant milestone in my programming journey. It was a reminder of how much can be learned from seemingly simple projects and the joy of creating something functional from scratch. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned programmer, never underestimate the value of tinkering in your free time.
