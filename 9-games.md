# Making Some Games: A Journey of Learning and Creation

As I delved into the world of programming, one of the most fulfilling activities was creating small games. These projects were not just about coding; they were about bringing ideas to life and learning through experimentation. Throughout my learning journey, I made three games that, while simple, provided a tremendous sense of achievement and joy.

## The Joy of Creation

Creating something, even if it's not the next big hit, is immensely rewarding because you invest your time and creativity into it. The process of building these games taught me valuable programming skills and offered a sense of accomplishment. This is why I encourage everyone, especially those learning to code, to take on game development projects. The experience is both educational and enjoyable.

### Game 1: Mini Game Session 1

The first game I developed was a two-player mini-game where players control ships aiming to reach a target block. The player who reaches the block first scores a point, and the one with the maximum points wins. It was a fun desktop game that introduced me to basic game mechanics and player interactions. You can watch the gameplay on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDhJkZqgWa8).

### Game 2: My Favorite Creation

My second game was a personal favorite. In this game, two players control rectangles that can toggle direction and fire a ball. The ball grows bigger, causing more damage when it hits the opponent. If a player doesn't fire, the ball auto-fires at the end. I enjoyed playing this game with my friend Umer Amjad, and it was a fantastic way to learn about game dynamics and competitive play.

### Game 3: The Bouncy Ball Adventure

The third game was a bouncy ball adventure playable on both Android and desktop. The game features three levels, where players jump on bars to reach a goal. This project was instrumental in teaching me about programming physics and level design in games. It was a delightful adventure that combined creativity with technical learning.

## Encouragement to Aspiring Game Developers

I strongly encourage anyone interested in programming to try making games. It doesn't matter if the game isn't perfect; what matters is the learning and satisfaction that come from creating something from scratch. Moreover, sharing your work publicly allows you to receive feedback, connect with other developers, and inspire others.

Making games was a pivotal part of my programming education. Each project, though simple, was a step forward in my journey, offering insights into game development and programming. Whether you're a novice or an experienced coder, dive into game creation and experience the joy of building your own digital worlds.
